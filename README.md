Cleaned and pre-processed employee absenteeism data, improving dataset reliability by over 90%. Resolved 100% of missing values, corrected inconsistent data types, and eliminated duplicate records using Pandas. 

# 🗂️ Absenteeism Data Preprocessing

The dataset contained 24 different absence reasons.

For memory optimization and simplification, I grouped these reasons into 4 categories:

1 → Group 1

2 → Group 2

3 → Group 3

4 → Group 4

Replaced the original "reason" column with these numeric group codes (1–4).

Dropped unnecessary tables/columns to reduce dataset size and improve efficiency.

Implemented a backup strategy to save the file after major transformations, ensuring data safety and version control.

For visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I used Tableau to create interactive dashboards and insights.
